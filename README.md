- [x] Test pivot gravity gains
- [x] Remove voltage constraints if everything works
- [x] Test manual controls
- [ ] Tune canandcolor for intake (coral + algae)
- [x] Test presets
- [ ] Pivot cancoder issues
- [ ] Test robot state selector

- [ ] SysID for elevator, pivot, wrist
- [ ] Swerve automation pt. 1 - rotational alignment
- [ ] Swerve automation pt.2 - pathfinding/translation alignment
- [ ] Auto
- [ ] Fine tune state transitions for efficiency
